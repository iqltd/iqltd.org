Happy New Year, 2026!
Actually, since this is a programming blog, I should say instead _Happy New Year, 0x7EA!_
Ha, ha. I'm so witty!

It's been about 15 years since I thought that having a blog _some day_ would be good.
That thought stayed with me all this time.
It was just a thought sitting in the back of my head, that would come up to the conscious mind every
now and then, without any strength needed to trigger action, only to subside again.
But by the power vested in me by the gods of new year's resolutions, I hereby declare that
_some day_ to be today.

I've been consuming blog posts all this time.
In my Java years, I found myself going back (via Google or Stack Overflow) to blogs like BalusC,
mkyong, Baeldung over and over.
After I started with Erlang, these were replaced by the blogs of Fred Hebert, Brujo Benavides,
Erlag Battleground etc.
That's because they were informative and well written.

This is one of the reasons why it was so hard to take any steps towards starting this blog.
The blogs I found useful were written by true professionals, with plenty of experience in the
technologies covered, and exquisite writing skills.
I felt that, if I'm not able to give back something comparable, there is not much point in doing it.
So I decided that I should start _some day_, when I'm eperienced enough to have useful things to
write about.

There were two issues with this.
First of all, as I learn things, I realize how much more there is to know.
Also, whatever I do know seems rather trivial.
Thus it's likely there won't be any moment in time when I start to feel that I'm experienced
enough to have useful things to write about.

Secondly, writing well is a skill that can only be developed by doing.
In other words, waiting until I have something worth writing about, means not developing those
skills before that moment.
It means risking that those articles might be written in an awkward style, with a confusing
structure, ineffective in getting the points across (a point that is painfully demonstrated by
this article).

In the meantime I accepted that I should start before feeling ready.
I accepted that I might not be proud of my blog posts for a while.
The only thing I needed was a moment to actually start.

This brings us to today, the 1st of January, 2026.
I have a job I love with a challenging, but not overwhelming workload.
My son is becoming less and less dependent on receiving constant attention from us.
We stopped changing countries every few years.
And the magic of the new year's resolution is upon us.

It is now or never.

(Actually, it is now or later, but that doesn't sound as exciting)

Cheers to a new beginning!
Happy New Year!
Happy New Blog!
